miRTarget 1.0.1
----------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* get_mirecords_pt(): Get predicted targets for miRNAs using miRecords database. Internet connexion is required.

* get_mirecords_vt(): Download validated targets for each miRNA. Internet connexion is required.

* get_mirtarbase_vt(): Download validated targets for each miRNA using miRTarBase. Internet connexion is required.

* combine_mir_vt(): Combine miRNA validated targets from differents sources (miRecords and miRTarbase)

* combine_mir_pvt(): Combine miRNA predicted and validated targets

* combine_mir_mrna_exprs(): Combine miRNA and mRNA expression data. The output dataset will be used for statistical approach-based miRNA target predictions.

* corr_mir_mrna(): Compute correlation between miRNA and mRNA expression

* viz_mrna_per_mir(): Visualize the number of correlated mRNAs per miRNA
